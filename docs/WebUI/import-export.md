# Import and Export editable PlantUML Diagrams

Similar to [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) it is possible to load and continue editing PlantUML diagram images.


## Export a diagram

Via the editor menu or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> (or <kbd>Meta</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> in the case of a Mac) you can open the file save dialog.
Here you can edit the file name, choose a file/diagram type and download the diagram.
The default is to download the PlantUML code.

## Import a diagram

This feature is based on the PlantUML meta data which currently **support only PNG and SVG** diagrams.
Besides a diagram image, you can of course also load a diagram code file.
Moreover, because it is so nice and convenient, we also added a drag-and-drop feature.
